    "It is part of the `jupyter project`, which is an extension of the `iPython project`.\n",
    "The iPython project and especially the iPython-Notebooks, were developed as an effort \n",
    "to have a free and open source alternative to Mathematica, with a similar interface.\n",
    "This is why it also uses an `Input-Output-Cell-Structure` and allows you to have your \n",
    "displayed data (i.e. tables, plots or formulas) right next to the code that produced them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The name JuPyteR is derived from the programming languages which its development\n",
    "initially was focused on `Julia`, `Python` and `R`.\n",
    "But nowadays it can run a lot more programming languages (i.e. bash, C++ or Fortran), as long as you have the needed interpreter or Compiler installed. For a list of available kernels and how to install them, have a look [here](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/Jupyter-kernels)."

    "## Common Pitfalls/Missconceptions\n",
    "### Execution order matters/Interpreter runtime memory\n",
    "Since normally all cells in jupyter-notebook are executed with the same kernel, the order of execution matters. If you for example define a variable `a=2` at the start of a notebook, run some code depending on it (i.e. `[In]a+5`, `[Out] 7`) in a different cell, redefine `a=3` at the end of your notebook and run the cell with code depending on `a` again, it will give a different output (`[Out] 8`) since `a` has changed. \n",
    "This allows you to run parts of you code without having to rerun everything again (i.e. very useful if you have a long running simulation and want to style the plot of the results).\n",
    "But it can also lead to problems, when we don't take this behavior into account when writing the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Common Problems:\n",
    "* **Broken Notebook** - \n",
    "The most severe problem that can occure is that when you open your notebook again and want to run your code (`Run All Cells`), it fails at a specific cell telling you that something (i.e. function, variable) isn't defined.\n",
    "The most common reason for that is that you deleted/renamed that 'something'/its cell in the last session or defined 'something' in a cell below the cell where it is first needed.  \n",
    "Since the kernel still remembered/already knew it (deleting from the notebook $\\neq$ deleting from the kernel), everything worked fine, but when you started a new session this 'something', wasn't there when it was needed, since the cells are evaluated in order from top to bottom.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-info\">\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:**\n",
    "    \n",
    "To solve ordering problems you can move cells in the notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "* **It doesn't change, even so it should** - \n",
    "This is an error, which will lead to a **Broken Notebook** and often wasts quite some time to find. This mostly happens if you rename (`refacor`) a function/variable in one part of your code, but forgot to change it somewhere else, since the kernel remembers the old function/variable, changing the new one won't affect parts where the old name is still used. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Solution\n",
    "To make sure that the notebook runs properly even if you run it for the first time, you should **always** confirm that everything it is runnable with a fresh kernel **after refactoring** code or **before stopping to work on it**.\n",
    "You can confirm this by running ``Restart Kernel and Run All Cells...``.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Not rendered Plots\n",
    "\n",
    "By default plots aren't rendered in the output cells. To activate this for `matplotlib` (which is also the default backend for `pandas`) you need to add the magic command `%matplotlib inline` or `%matplotlib notebook`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For other libraries like `bokhe` or `ploty` there are special plugins needed to work in jupyter-lab, since they relay on extra javascript code, those plugin are called [jupyter extensions](https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions).\n",
    "\n",
    "### ModuleNotFoundError\n",
    "During this course we will introduce different libraries and how to use them. Depending on your Python installation, those might not be installed, which will cause the `ModuleNotFoundError` when you try to run the examples provided. We recommend to use Anaconda as your installation of choice, since the installer are available for all major platforms (Linux, Windows and MacOS) and most modules come as binaries (called `wheels` in Python), which means you don't need to compile them yourself. Also the default Anaconda installer comes with most libraries we present you included. If any library is still missing you can install it by running: \n",
    "\n",
    "`conda  install missing_library_name`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't want to use Anaconda or this library is only on `PyPi` (Python Packagagin Index)  and not on Anaconda, you can always install it by running: \n",
