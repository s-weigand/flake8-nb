Many thanks go to the creators and contributors of flake8_.
Which inspired me to write this hack on top of it and supplies nearly all
of the functionality.

This packages skeleton was created with Cookiecutter_ and the
`audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage`_ project template.

The idea to use cell tags was inspired by the use of cell tags in nbval_.
